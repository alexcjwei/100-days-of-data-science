# 100-days-of-data-science
Trying to get gud at machine learning, will try to do a little bit every day for 100 days and track my progress here

## Getting Started
### Day 0: 09/07/23
* Read Andrew Ng's ["How to Build Your Career in AI" eBook](https://info.deeplearning.ai/how-to-build-a-career-in-ai-book#MYL-form)

### Day 1: 09/08/23
* Decided to start working my way through Kaggle's Getting Started challenges.
* Working on the classic MNIST dataset. I must've done this before, but am doing it without following any tutorial this time and am learning a lot more along the way (not just hitting run on cells).
* Here's the repo where I'll keep track of those notebooks: https://github.com/alexcjwei/getting-started-kaggle
